### Teaching
<font size="3">
 <div align="justify" style="background-color: hsl(120, 80%, 90%)">
  My <b>teaching vision</b> is to stimulate learning by engaging students in their learning environment, promoting higher order thinking skills while recognizing their opinions and background to produce highly innovative, creative, skilled and dedicated graduates. In the modern era, students learn better through experience with an inductive approach than the traditional deductive learning approach. Therefore, my philosophy is to create an interactive classroom.

         <div align="justify" style="background-color: hsl(60, 80%, 90%)">While pursuing my Doctoral degree, my research centered around dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) strategies aimed at achieving satisfactory performance for both primary and secondary users in cognitive radio networks. The focus of my dissertation was on facilitating greater channel access opportunities for secondary users through the implementation of four techniques: channel aggregation, priority-based queues, spectrum leasing, and channel reservation. Enabling real-time and quality of service (QoS) applications in wireless communication networks is a challenging task. This is due to the certain characteristics of such networks, like limited battery capacity, limited processing power, and limited storage. In <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6684549"
target="_blank">the article</a>, we propose a priority-based queuing system which can be applied over a CRN where the queuing schemes are introduced based on the delay tolerance of interrupted services. </div><br/>
